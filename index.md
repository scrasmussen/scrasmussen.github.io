[Alpha Version of Website] status: busy with research

I am a PhD Candidate studying Computer Science, with an emphasis in High
  Performance Computing (HPC), at Cranfield University in the United Kingdom.

My background is in computational mathematics and compilers.
My current research focuses on compilers, PGAS and MPI communication and I am
  interested in helping people run code on GPUs.
